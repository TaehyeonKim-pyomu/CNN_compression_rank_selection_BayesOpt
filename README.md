# BayesOpt-based Global Optimal Rank Selection for Compression of CNNs
This is an implementation of "Bayesian Optimization-Based Global Optimal Rank Selection for Compression of Convolutional Neural Networks, IEEE Access" paper.

# Abstract 

Finding the optimal rank is a crucial problem beacause the rank is the only hyperparameter for controlling computational complexity and accuracy in compressed CNNs. To solve this problem, we propose a global optimal rank selection method based on Bayesian optimization. By utilizing both a simple objective function and a proper optimization scheme, the proposed method produces a global optimal rank that provides a good trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy degradation.
